# Active Context: REM

## Current Work Focus

Enhancing the AI dream analysis experience with a structured Jungian psychology prompt and refining micro-interactions throughout the app.

## Recent Changes

- **Jungian AI Prompt**: Updated the Gemini analysis prompt to act as an empathetic Jungian dream analyst. Responses now follow a strict 3-paragraph structure (Core Theme, Symbol Decoding, Actionable Insight) with **bolded** key symbols.
- **Swipe Delete UI**: Refined the swipe-to-delete button to be a smaller, centered 48x48px circle.
- **Bug Fix**: Restored the missing `generateDreamImage` function in the dream store.

## Active Decisions

- AI analysis uses dream content only to keep the prompt simple.
- Sleep Companion features are under discussion, not yet implemented.

## Next Steps

1. Test the new Jungian analysis output.
2. Continue discussion on Sleep Companion features.
3. Iterate on UI polish based on user feedback.
